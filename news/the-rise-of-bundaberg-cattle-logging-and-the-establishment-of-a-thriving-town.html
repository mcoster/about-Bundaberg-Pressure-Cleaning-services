Before European colonization, the land surrounding the lower reaches of the Burnett River was characterized by two distinct environments: the <strong>Woongarra Scrub</strong>, a lush subtropical rainforest, and the <strong>Barolin Plains</strong>, a lightly timbered grassland along the coastal fringe. These areas were unsuitable for sheep farming; however, British settlers discovered that the land was well-suited for cattle ranching. In the early 1860s, the first cattle stations in the Bundaberg area were established, with <strong>Branyan</strong> on the south side and <strong>Tantitha</strong> on the north side of the Burnett River.</p>

<p>The logging industry also played a crucial role in the region&#39;s development. In 1867, timber companies, including one owned by <strong>William Pettigrew</strong>, began logging the Woongarra Scrub. The following year, <strong>Samuel Johnston</strong> erected a sawmill at <strong>Waterview</strong>, located on the north bank of the Burnett River. This sawmill quickly became a key supplier of timber for the area, sustaining the local economy until its closure in 1903 due to flood damage.</p>

<p>In 1867, timber-getters and farmers <strong>John and Gavin Steuart</strong> established the <strong>Woondooma property</strong>, which included a few houses and a wharf situated on the northern banks of the Burnett River, the site of modern Bundaberg North. The region&#39;s growth prompted an official survey in 1869 led by <strong>John Charlton Thompson</strong>, with assistance from <strong>James Ellwood</strong> and <strong>Alfred Dale Edwards</strong>. This survey culminated in the gazetting of the town of Bundaberg across the river on the higher, southern banks.</p>

<p>The first land sale for Bundaberg took place in <strong>Maryborough</strong> on <strong>May 11, 1870</strong>, marking a pivotal moment in the town&#39;s development. Notably, hotelier <strong>John Foley</strong> purchased the original lots, laying the foundation for what would become a vibrant and prosperous community.</p>

<p>As the timber and cattle industries flourished, Bundaberg began to evolve from a small settlement into a bustling town, driven by the economic opportunities provided by these sectors. The legacy of this era remains evident today in Bundaberg&#39;s agricultural and logging heritage, contributing to its identity as a key player in Queensland&#39;s regional economy.</p>
